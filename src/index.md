# Tsung-Ju Chiang

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am passionate about programming and have a keen interest in theoretical computer science,
particularly programming language theory and type theory.

Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Professor Ningning Xie](https://xnning.github.io).
You can find more information about our group on our [group website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~prose/).
