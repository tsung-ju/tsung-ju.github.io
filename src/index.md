# Tsung-Ju Chiang

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I like programming.
I write short hacks and small programs when I feel like it.

I also like math and computer science,
especially logic, type theory, and programming language theory.

Currently I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto.
