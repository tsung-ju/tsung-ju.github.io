# Tsung-Ju Chiang

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I like programming.
I write short hacks and small programs when I feel like it (check out my GitHub!).

I also like theoretical computer science,
especially programming languages, logic, and type theory.

I like visual arts, for their beauty and expressiveness.
I draw occasionally.

Currently I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto in Canada.
