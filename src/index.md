# Tsung-Ju Chiang

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am passionate about programming and have a keen interest in theoretical computer science,
particularly programming language theory and type theory.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Professor Ningning Xie.
