# Research

I am a MSc student in the [PLSE group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~prose/)
at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/),
working with [Prof. Ningning Xie](https://xnning.github.io).

I am interested in programming languages, logic, and type theory.
I enjoy exploring the connections between these areas,
and applying the techniques for precise program modeling.

My current research focuses on modal type theory and its use in typed meta-programming.
