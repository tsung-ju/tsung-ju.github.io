# Research

I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/),
affiliated with the [PLSE group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~prose/),
under the supervision of [Professor Ningning Xie](https://xnning.github.io).

I am interseted in programming languages, logic, and type theory,
with a focus on applying these techniques for precise program modeling.
My current research centers on modal type theories and their use in typed meta-programming.
Additionally, I am exploring effects and coeffects.
